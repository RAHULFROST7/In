yes boring tell me tell me something about you myself my name is Gauri Sharma di I am from Udaipur Rajasthan and doing computer science engineering from Gitanjali Institute of Technical studies I secured 9.2 CGPA in 10th standard 73.4 CG percentage in 12th standard and currently and Engineering my advocate school is 77% computer science that is it is present in every field and hands I have invested tease last 3.5 almost years and a developing my software skills my technical skills include the programming in Python javasc C++ data development humanity so these all are my technical skills and I also use this project using management project and attendance management project in smart India classical dance
my success by the success of joining TCS thank you so much specific point about TCS which makes TCS different from other It MNCs TCS is has a brain name it is known it is a multinational company and it has a very good brand name and that it would give me a good start for my career secondly it has a work life balance I have talk to many of my friends who are in TCS and they say that teachers give the very good work like balance so that is the second point third point is the colleagues there very future stick in the skills so there is a lot to learn from them multinational company I would like to I would have the chance to even go people of different nationalities has been in the industry of job security
which are the campus interviews have you appeared for advertise been the results I have interviewed for land which is in Udaipur only and I got selected for it I also interview for Gateway Industries I was not selected in the interview I got to the interview part but was not selected so that's that I only given to this selected for Gateway I have not answer the technical questions very well as compared to the other candidate my technical skills I have been preparing and doing or most everyday so I think that I prepare for TCS if I join TCS software company
for you what are the three important things that one should consider before joining any organisation as a fresher look if there is a lot to learn from the company I mean they should be very steep like growing curve in the company secondly there should be colleagues and everything should be very Frank so that they help you in everyday and thirdly for me they should be a brand names so that there is a satisfaction that yes I was a level and now I can go to the next level I want to work with latest technology
good job qualities I am sure you will be able to patent to thank you anymore
job security is more important than salary good afternoon sir
Jaisa Thoda Thoda example of how many columns are there for example of the player so we can increase the counter with the number that comes in the dice and then we can find the snakes for example
you want to use it increasing the counter value or you have to decreement the counter value in form of determine it functions for example of the dice value for if the dice value or the that block value in which the counter is right now is a 5 so I have assign the five already that 5 is a ladder so then it will increase and for example if 12 is a snake then I already define that 12 unit to decrement the value by for example so we can have to write the code
as well so using these we can define the scope of the variables or the functions like if it is public then it can be used all through and if it is protected than only the subclasses can you said and a private than only the current classes
showcase ok
